  description: "Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tacticsâ€™ techniques are cross-listed here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses.<br>
    Identifies when a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy is removed in Microsoft 365. An adversary may remove a DLP policy to evade existing DLP monitoring."

    <li>Ensure proper process and file permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    <li>Ensure proper Registry permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    <li>Ensure proper user permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with security/logging services.</li>
    </ol><br>
